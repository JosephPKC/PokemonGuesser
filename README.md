# PokemonGuesser
Simple web app project mostly to learn about CI/CD, front end, etc.

## General Idea for the Program
It is a game that loads up a random Pokemon, and hides all of its stats, moves, etc.

The user then tries to guess as many of these things as possible, getting points for each correct guess.
